# Capture of vaccines in Mexico

In Mexico, 8 types of vaccines have been applied: AztraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Cansino, Janssen, Sinovac, Covishield, and Sputnik. All these cases are marked by a lack of transparency in the process of authorization, purchase, and access to the vaccines, which has been carried out with public funds. The Mexican government, like other governments in the world, has accepted the terms imposed by the companies in contracts on which the information is shielded from public view, creating conditions for heightened corruption, conflicts of interest, and lack of access, in particular for the most vulnerable. As the pharmaceutical companies enrich themselves with public funds, the right to health, which should be the centerpiece of a comprehensive health policy with a human rights perspective, is undermined.
