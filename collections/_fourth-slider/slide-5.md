# What the pandemic left behind
## 5. People's Vaccines

[The People's Vaccine Alliance](https://peoplesvaccine.org/) is a coalition of over 100 organizations and networks supported by public health experts, activists, heads of State, and Nobel laureates. Together, they have worked towards ensuring universal access to COVID-19 vaccines by advocating for the liberalization of patents for vaccines and drugs. Despite this work, the WTO's approval of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver [was delayed and provided less protection than initially proposed](https://peoplesvaccine.org/resources/media-releases/wto-reaction-2022/).
