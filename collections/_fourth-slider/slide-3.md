# What the pandemic left behind
## 3. Inequitable access to healthcare

[As of May 22, 2023](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#explore-the-global-situation), **66.31% of COVID-19 booster doses** were administered **in high-income countries**, 49.94% in upper-middle-income countries, 18.84% in lower-middle-income countries, and **only 3.18% in low-income countries**. [Low-income countries had to increase their health budgets by 56.6% to vaccinate 70% of their population](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/covid-19-government-response-tracker), while [high-income countries only needed to increase them by 0.8%](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/covid-19-government-response-tracker). The pandemic severely impacted low-income countries' health systems, which lacked personnel and infrastructure, further limiting access to vaccines.
