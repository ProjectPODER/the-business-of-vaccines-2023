## 4. Monopoly, patents, and corporate capture

The industry's incentives to monopolize products explain the predominance of bilateral agreements, acceptance of company-benefiting clauses, and lack of transparency. **Companies prioritize profits over health despite taxpayer-funded innovations**. **Novavax was granted federal funding for their research**. **Moderna received funding and technical support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)**. On the other hand, **Pfizer** did not accept research funding but **received financial aid from the German government through BioNtech**. Additionally, Pfizer received public money from the US government's advance purchases. **AstraZeneca, Janssen, Moderna, and Pfizer** were granted **42832.20 million dollars** by the [**Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)**](https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/app/barda/coronavirus/COVID19.aspx) for developing, producing, and pre-purchasing vaccines and treatments.
