# What the pandemic left behind
## 1. Vaccines in record time

Before the COVID-19 crisis, no vaccine had taken less than four years to be developed by laboratories, approved by regulators, and produced for distribution. Due to the pandemic, vaccine development efforts were accelerated and completed in less than a year. The development was facilitated by prior research on coronaviruses, regulatory changes by agencies that streamlined the paperwork and procedures for vaccine approval, public investments in vaccine development, and early government procurement that reduced the risk of producing the vaccine.
