# What the pandemic left behind
## 2. Vaccine nationalism

Both health emergency and geopolitical criteria drove the accelerated approval process. The **FDA has only approved vaccines for emergency use from four of the largest US pharmaceutical companies**: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen, and Novavax. **Vaccines from Russia, China, India, and the United Kingdom were not approved by the FDA**, even though all except for Russia's vaccine were approved by the WHO. Although various international cooperation mechanisms were established to facilitate global access to vaccines, they proved insufficient in mitigating inequalities and limiting vaccine hoarding. UNICEF reported that **69% of vaccine doses were obtained through bilateral agreements**, the European Union procured 19%, and **only 7% were obtained through the COVAX mechanism**.
