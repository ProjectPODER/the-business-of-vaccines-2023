# CORPORATE SECRECY. PROTECTING COMPANIES BEFORE PEOPLE

Outside of the **11 vaccines on the WHO emergency use list**, the [UNICEF COVID-19 vaccine market dashboard](https://www.unicef.org/supply/covid-19-market-dashboard) provides information on **518 vaccine procurement agreements**. However, **only 26 of these agreements disclose the purchase price** agreed upon for the vaccines. This practice heightens inequalities in access to vaccines. Countries with smaller markets or unable to meet the high costs of vaccines and treatments are left at the end of the line, placing people's lives at risk.
