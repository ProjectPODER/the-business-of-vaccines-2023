# Who wins with vaccines?

Information on companies’ beneficial owners is scarce and we obtained information on investors in 14 companies that produce vaccines. Most of their investors are private capital investment funds, as well as public capital investment funds and pension fund managers. Of the investors with holdings in more than 3 pharmaceutical companies, 20 invest in AstraZeneca and in Johnson & Johnson, 17 in Pfizer, 14 in Novavax, and 12 in CanSino. **Norges Bank Investment Management** and **The Vanguard Group, Inc.** invest in 11 of the 14 pharmaceutical companies we analyzed; **Blackrock** in 10; and **State Street Global Advisors, Inc.**, and **Geode Capital** in 7. [Blacrock](https://poderlatam.org/project/conoceablackrock/){:target="_blank"} and The Vanguard Group are the world’s largest investment funds.
