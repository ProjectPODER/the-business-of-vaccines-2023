# The pharmaceutical industry is highly concentrated

This industry operates practically as a monopoly. The 20 biggest laboratories worldwide concentrate 60% of the pharmaceutical industry’s global sales. These companies have the power to influence global health policy placing their profits before human lives.  While in [high and medium-high income countries more than 80% of the population has been vaccinated, in low-income countries the figure is barely above 20%](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#explore-the-global-situation){:target="_blank"}. As regards new treatments, By late March, [Pfizer](https://s28.q4cdn.com/781576035/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/PFE-USQ_Transcript_2022-05-03.pdf){:target="_blank"} had produced 8 million treatments of its antiviral drug Paxlovid, of which almost all shipments were for use in the United States, Canada, Japan, some countries in the European Union, South Korea, Israel, Australia, and the United Kingdom, all high-income countries.
