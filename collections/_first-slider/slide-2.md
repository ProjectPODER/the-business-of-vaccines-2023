# The pharmaceutical industry is highly concentrated

This industry operates practically as a monopoly. The 20 biggest laboratories worldwide concentrate 60% of the pharmaceutical industryâ€™s global sales. These companies have the power to influence global health policy, placing their profits before human lives. As of May 10, 2023, the global administration of vaccine doses has surpassed [13 billion](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/act-accelerator/act-a-transition-report-final-final.pdf?sfvrsn=846746d_1&download=true). Yet, there remains a disparity in vaccination rates across different income levels. [High and upper-middle-income nations have inoculated a more significant portion of their populations (74.32% and 78.74%) than lower-middle and low-income nations (58.89% and 25.42%)](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#explore-the-global-situation).
