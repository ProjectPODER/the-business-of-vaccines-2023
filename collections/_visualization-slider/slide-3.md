# MASSIVE PROFITS, NO INFORMATION

We can access public information that lets us know the number of vaccine doses contracted with each company. However, we only have confirmation that [Mexico paid 309 million dollars for 77.4 million doses of AstraZeneca](https://poderlatam.org/2021/01/astrazeneca-vende-vacunas-a-mexico-por-309-millones-de-dolares/) and [committed an advance payment of US$ 159,876,920 to Gavi Alliance for 51,100,100 doses](https://poderlatam.org/2021/04/mas-sobre-la-compra-de-vacunas-en-mexico/). [The government's contract with Pfizer](https://portales.sre.gob.mx/transparencia/gestion-diplomatica-vacunas-covid-documentos/83-pfizer) was initially for 34.4 million doses, but it has since been extended and renegotiated, though this information was kept private. [Mexico has already received 50.2 million doses of the Comirnaty vaccine and 8 million doses of the pediatric Comirnaty vaccine](https://portales.sre.gob.mx/transparencia/gestion-diplomatica-vacunas-covid/). As of now, the government has contracted **35 million doses of the Cansino Biologics vaccine**, but only 14.1 million doses have been received. Additionally, they have secured **20 million doses of Sinovac**, **24 million doses of Sputnik V**, of which 20 million have been received, and **2.03 million of the Covishield** vaccine from the Serum Institute of India. Moreover, the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology of Cuba has provided **9 million doses of the Abdala** vaccine. In addition, donations of 1,350,000 doses of Janssen vaccine, 6,272,000 doses of Moderna vaccine, 804,000 doses of Pfizer pediatric vaccine, 3 million of Pfizer vaccine, and an additional 9,386,800 from AstraZeneca have been received.
