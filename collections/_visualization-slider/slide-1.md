# PANDEMIC OF OPACITY

**Mexico has signed contracts for 9 COVID-19 vaccines and received donations from the US, Canada, South Korea, and Moderna**. Adding contracts and donations, Mexico has secured **281,742,800 vaccine doses**. A total of **215,585,350 vaccine doses have been administered**. After multiple requests for access to information over two years, the Supreme Court has ruled that the public versions of the contracts should be published. However, these versions still do not disclose the amount of doses purchased, the price of the doses, and the companies' disclaimers. The companies had requested the Mexican government to withhold this information, and the government had agreed. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact amount of public funds paid to each vaccine-producing company.
