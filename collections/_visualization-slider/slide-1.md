# PANDEMIC OF OPACITY

Mexico has signed **7 contracts** to acquire COVID-19 vaccines and has received donations of doses from the United States government. Between contracts and donations, Mexico has secured **261 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines**, of which through March 9, 2022, it had received [225,615,255](https://transparencia.sre.gob.mx/gestion-diplomatica-vacunas-covid/). Although we requested copies of the contracts through requests for access to information, and even though the Federal Institute for Access to Public Information and Data Protection (Spanish acronym INAI) has ordered the government to publish the documents, **public versions of only 5 contracts have been published**, with the prices of doses and clauses releasing the companies from liability redacted. Because the companies asked the Mexican government to redact this information and the government acquiesced, we have no way of knowing how much public money was paid to each vaccine maker.
