# COVID BENEFIT$

The companies that produce COVID-19 vaccines do not publish information on their beneficial owners. Through several public and private databases, PODER has obtained information on the leading shareholders, owners, and controllers of  the companies that have contracts for vaccines with Mexico. In the case of Gavi Alliance, we have published information on its donors. **Norges Bank Investment Management, The Vanguard Group**, and **BlackRock Inc.** are the leading shareholders in 5 of the makers of vaccines used in Mexico. The Russian Federation is the leading investor, through the **Russian Direct Investment Fund**, in the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, which produces the Sputnik V vaccine. **Capital Research and Management Company** and its owners, managers, and founders **Xuefeng Yu, Huihua Mao, Dongxu Qiu, and Tao Zhu** are the beneficial owners of Cansino. **Saif Partners IV, Yin Weidong, Prime Success, L.P., and Vivo Capital, LLC** are the beneficiaries of Sinovac. **Cyrus Poonawalla** is the founder, director, and beneficial owner of the Serum Institute of India.
