# CORRUPTION AND IMMUNITY

**The companies that benefited from vaccine contracts asked that information on the contracts be withheld**. In Mexico, this violates Article 70.XXVII and 70.XXVIII of the General Law on Transparency and Access to Information, and as a result, the government has been violating the right to information established in Article 6 of the Constitution. This is a common mechanism of corporate capture that companies have used to continue negotiating the price of doses and terms of contracting with the highest bidders, which has, in turn, caused the phenomenon of stockpiling vaccines in the wealthiest countries. Such conduct is not unique to the Mexican government. Companies leverage their power to impose their terms in countries with weak institutions permeable to corporate capture. In response to corporate pressure, [13 countries in Latin America amended their laws to purchase vaccines between September and February 2021](https://poderlatam.org/2021/03/farmaceuticas-vendieron-vacunas-a-america-latina-con-beneficios-legales-y-tributarios/). It is of crucial importance to gain access to information on contracts and public and private funding for vaccine development and acquisition because concealing such information raises the risk of conflicts of interest and corruption.
