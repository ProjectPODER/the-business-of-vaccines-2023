# Virus of Opacity and Lack of Transparency in Treatments

Public information on contracts for oral antiviral treatments in Mexico has yet to be available despite being purchased with public funds. The total amount spent on the contracts, the price of each course of treatment, and the conditions agreed upon between the government and the pharmaceutical company are unknown. CENAPRECE, in response to the access to information request 330026923000414, indicates that on July 11, 2022, a **"Manufacturing and Supply Agreement" was signed**, and itâ€™s still in force, between the pharmaceutical company **Pfizer Export, BV**, and **the Ministry of Health** as the "PURCHASER" party. **The contract is classified as reserved for national security reasons and due to the confidentiality clause imposed by Pfizer for five years**, with failure to comply resulting in early cancellation of the contract and lawsuits against the Mexican State.
