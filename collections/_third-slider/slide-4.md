# Mexico manufactures generic drugs but purchases patented ones

In November 2021, Pfizer granted 35 voluntary licenses for Paxlovid through the [Medicines Patent Pool](https://medicinespatentpool.org/). The Latin American countries where the distribution of the generic has been authorized are Belize, Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Pfizer has filed patents in excluded countries until 2041, making it impossible for them to acquire the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) to manufacture the product or its generic version cheaply.
The companies producing the generic are located in 12 countries, with only 3 in Latin America: Neolpharma (Mexico), Magnachem (Dominican Republic), and Nortec Qu√≠mica (Brazil). **Neolpharma produces generic drugs in Mexico**, but the **Ministry of Health had to purchase 300,000 patent treatment courses** because Mexico is not included in countries with voluntary MPP licenses. If we consider that a course of treatment costs $530 in the US, we could be talking about **US$159 million**.
