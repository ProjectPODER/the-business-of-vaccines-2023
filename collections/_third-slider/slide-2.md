# Who can have access to antivirals?
Like vaccines, high-income countries monopolize oral antivirals, jeopardizing access for  low- and middle-income countries with low vaccination rates. [Only 2.17% of antiviral sales went to lower-middle-income countries, while 70.31% went to high-income countries](https://launchandscalefaster.org/covid-19/therapeutics).
